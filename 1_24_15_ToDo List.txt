*** New file type because the ToDo list before each new changelog was taking up a ton of space
	This is used as a reference and checklist - this list is added to when a new <date>_changelog_todo file is created ***

***	Starting 1/24/16 the ToDoList will be organized and used a bit differently.
	First, there are several categories of items to do. These are listed below to jump to the category easier.
	EXPANSION SCRIPT ADDITIONS are particularly important to complete asap and, although DB WORK, deserve their own category.
	Progress notes can be added into this file to reduce searching in multiple files.

; ToDo: increase poison sac drops on NPCs that poison - by making new loottables - done 1/25/16
	- moreso for snakes, spiders give silk

; ToDo: giant scarab in EC - guards don't attack - need to recheck this, test shows as attacking <- confirmed

; ToDo: rethink pelt drops, ruined,lq,mq,hq = 8,4,2,1 in terms of drop frequency - maybe 6,3,2,1 - may need tweaking but done - 1/26/16
	- HQ drops too often off low mobs, MQ even more - unless I am lucky
	- lower drop rates on pelts!! - specifically MQ/HQ

ToDo: fix stagnant mobs in west karana, no animals should be stagnant
	- created query to make grids when ambitious in WIP folder `qey2hh1_mundane NPCs~`

ToDo: fix stagnant mobs in freporte, no animals should be stagnant

ToDo: kos mobs aggro even if green - make some stupid

ToDo: nro - more rattlesnakes less spiders P99

ToDo: west commons - put a griffon in

ToDo: consider raising the prices of merchant 50+ spells

ToDo: Feerrott - `dark_assassin` has no spawn entry but roams western feerrott and is a quest
	- did not check NPC/spawns near fear

; ToDo: almost no early level mobs should have any regen over 1 - complete for original 1/29/16
	- found explanation - <CalcNPCRegen();> - sets NPC regen if 0 in the DB - \zone\npc.cpp(2047)
	- this means the field should be set, otherwise the code will set it for us
	- hp_regen_rate was significantly reduced from the default code - should request feedback
	
ToDo: shady/evil efp freeport faction is few for ranger (not many dubious or worse)

ToDo: asps in ecommons instead of rattlesnake? - not an issue

; ToDo: check on archery skill max for rangers, titanium has it at 200 at 50 - done 1/15/16

........................
........................
- CODE_WORK
........................
; ToDo: need to keep the zones static for a minute or two after players leave for their safety and to reduce exploiting - 1/21/16 - complete 1/25/16 - fixed 2/12/16

; ToDo: change how dispels work to old way - need historic confirmation - 12/10/15 - complete, I think - 1/27/16

ToDo: NPCs/Pets fall through the floor in old arena - likely a map file although pathing may fix this? - 12/26/15

ToDo: CaclMaxMana occurs twice per tick for PCs - sometimes twice, sometimes once, process acts funny - 12/11/15

; ToDo: think about making a rule for dot worn off message - 12/23/15 - done 1/27/16

ToDo: work out berserker frenzy bonus/penalty - 12/23/15

; ToDo: look into kick/bash damage a bit more - 9/27/15 - be prepared to use newer formula and possible revert code and make a rule - backburner - make a rule for this - complete - 1/27/16

ToDo: fix backstab - see 9/27/15, 10/11/15, 2/29/16

ToDo: find solution to boats lagging zones - see 10/4/15, 10/6/15, 12/19/15

ToDo: Fix mana/end levels lower after zoning - only in the UI - casting a spell syncs UI with server - see 10/12/15 - many unsuccessful tests 12/14/15, 12/18/15 - 2/4/16
	- poss solution to mana/end lower on death - look for similar -> <Group::SendHPPacketsTo> - \zone\groups.cpp(384)

ToDo: look into - Songs do not go in song window - 12/20/15

ToDo: look into resists - torven (eqemu) data - 12/20/15

ToDo: Think about leaving NPC pets up if their owners die - 12/29/15

; ToDo: Consider creating/implementing a rule which limits xp if in group and pets do more than X % damage - 12/29/15 - unnecessary 2/12/16
	- apparently this isn't needed but a rule reducing XP if pet does 50%+ damage while not in group - make a rule - done 2/4/16

; ToDo: removed message about the item you are missing from tradeskill combine attempts when missing a component - 1/28/16
	- this may be unnecessary if I can disable the newer UI
	- unnecessary with rules set as they are - newer UI combines disabled

; ToDo: mobs hop if engaged at their spawn point - fixed hopefully - 1/24/16
	- I think it has to do with guard point - it did but, it was he fixZ rules that made it better

; ToDo: check on double attack rates for NPCs - they get a twenty level boost at the current setting
	- <NPCDualAttackModifier> - \common\features.h(174)
	- the question may not be if they do it too often but if DA is high
	- another option is to lower this check for certain level mobs, maybe under 20
	- suspended this issue because I was seeing frontal backstab attempts

; ToDo: think about raising the flee speed at 15 -20% P99 appears to have it higher - see 1/27/16

ToDo: con levels off by 1 at least up to 12, I think it goes half level up to then at least

ToDo: sneak and buying from merchants, I thought you had to be behind before sneak
	- find out if sneak never fails (\zone\client_packet.cpp(12687) 1/28/16
	- sneak was fine in with test in tox
	- sneak fails but you can sneak THEN go behind someone and it will work
	- hide works if it succeeds and it doesn't matter if you are in front or not

ToDo: when client goes linkdead the zone server doesn't drop the client for 3 minutes - this is normal
	- the entire process from client crash to zone dropping client took 5 minutes
	- unsure what that means but there may be a link with spawning as a mob name
		- this happened in the middle of a battle, the DB and log showed the mob correctly, it is something with the client 2/4/16
		- this issue was happening before the static zone changes
	- maybe this could be the way to limit players from /q out

ToDo: Client crashed twice in short time when I clicked items to looting the loot window - poss related to above

ToDo: item dropped on lift stays suspended where dropped

; ToDo: archery should probably have LoS - use spell logic - complete - 1/27/16

ToDo: issue with player names turning into spawn names after death

; ToDo: from fear pathing, mob will occasionally die and his corpse will fall under the ground - fixed 2/11/16
	- west karana mobs fall through the ground - seems to happen when going up/down 'z'

ToDo: look into group code - groups seem to disband - thought I heard something about eqemu code fixing this - not - fixed disbanding issues (the worst) - several minor issues remain
	- add logging features in various places to monitor what's going on
	- pet hp do not show actual % to other group members, occasionally
	- poss issue with disbanding self - fixed
	- areas to look for disband issue <Client::LeaveGroup()>, <Group::DisbandGroup()>, <Group::DelMember>, <Group::DelMemberOOZ> - \zone\groups.cpp
	- Fixed the majority of disbanding issues with groups larger than 2 <Group::DelMember> - \zone\groups.cpp(614,637)
		- commented out 2 sections of code
		- creating logging features in many places to understand and find the issues - \zone\groups.cpp(547,584,886,1163) \zone\client_packet.cpp(6333)
		- not all issues were resolved - when resolved the logging features should be removed/disabled
	- leader disbanding in a zone with no other group members does not transfer leadership
		- this and a few other minor issues are described in `group invite_disband mechanics.txt`
	- reverted the logging features (moderate) until the next round of fixes

ToDo: fizzles seemed a bit high - additionally, the high level code doesn't seem to give any weight to skill differences ie. <diff> - tweaked and seems better so far
	- I should change this with the channelchance idea in mind
ToDo: fizzle rate seems a little harsh maybe lower it 5% overall or change stat influence, maybe make a rule for base fizzlechance as well - changed
	- lower the min chance to 8% adn stat to 6 or something similar to channelchance where you get a bonus the closer to the skill cap you are - changed
	- basefizzle set to 12 and stats influence to 8 - rate is better at lower levels
	- consider adding another condition similar to channelchance
	- fizzle chance gets lower as char levels in lower levels, at least
	- added fizzle mod to subtract an amount based on proximity to spell level skill (level 9 spell level skill = 50)
	- Added additional code to <Client::CheckFizzle> to help mitigate high fizzle rates - \zone\spells.cpp(902)
		- this applies when skill is within 10 points of the "spell cap" - spell level * 5 + 5
	- issue with specialization and lowering fizzlechance too much - guessing the altered basefizzle value
	- work on channelchance equation it just doesn't seem right to penalize players when gaining a level - 1/28/16
	- the skill range could be greater to mitigate the "penalty" to the bonus
	- major fix to rates lvl 21+ on 2/9/16

ToDo: group level range for xp is funky - groups in general are a little funky - see `group experience` in WIP
	- \zone\attack.cpp(2267) points to xp, qs logging and kill credit, I doubt there are any issues with these
	- I don't think the issue is with the exp code, it's likely somewhere in the group code although tweaking the xp code isn't a bad idea
	- the anti-PL code could use some tweaking with xp rates as low as they are - \zone\exp.cpp(894)

ToDo: speed test - used #distance command - was DB todo now CODE
	- there appears to be some catchup "on-tick"
	- on local test server the mob appears to lose ground then catch up, likely due to server lag or ticks although tested on local
	- characters appear to follow at the same distance
ToDo: as far a speed and npcs catching when they are clearly a tiny bit slower:
	- guessing pc speed uses the z to calculate distance where mob speed does not
	- reduced speed of NPCs as a temporary, long term fix - get back to this later maybe
	- speed seems pretty good now although mobs are a bit slow - 2/6/16

ToDo: see if I can disable maps outside of noob zones
	- couldn't find anything on this in the code - there are updates going on, just unsure where it's happening

; ToDo: Consider putting code in to have the chance of skill increases adjusted based on relative difficulty of the skill at the time of use - 1/21/16 - see 1/29-31/16
	- for melee skills this would be mob con level
		- successful hits/dodges etc give an increased chance
	- for casting skills this is would be current skill vs level "/con" of current skill vs spell level skill
	- change certain melee skills to only check for increases if successful, like on a hit
	ToDo: put check increase skill in for all skills similar to tradeskills - see 1/27/16
	- also add in con levels chances
	- large project complete 

; ToDo: too much aggro on regen spells - 1/28/16 - see 2/12/16 - fixed with all the aggro changes 2/18/16
	- aggro = spell mana / 4 * players affected (this part is a guess)

ToDo: Accuracy: the level diff accuracy curve should look hyperbolic or maybe similar to the -cube root function used for skills - 1/28/16
	- forgot to think about how skill should continue to give a negative affect to accuracy if the max skill does not compare equally to the melee classes
		- H2H is a good example - casters' max weapon skill is another

ToDo: Have the zone update when a player enters it - 2/4/16

ToDo: try to figure out how to stop /played timer when char logs out differently - look here -> \zone\client_packet.cpp(1334) - 2/4/16

ToDo: something was funny when I failed making metal bits, the result was one bit on the cursor but, it didn't seem to add to the existing stack - 2/4/16

ToDo: remove shared bank and extra bank slots - 2/4/16

	- need to work on quest late 2000 is first instance

; ToDo: the path file made the young kodiak go to it way out of the way in EC - done 2/4/16
	- maybe moving just the nodes which are in the open will fix this
	- removed all .path files in outdoor zones

ToDo: look into how spell crits were calculated (ie +100% or a range up to 100%) - 12/16/15

; ToDo: look into variable dot damage in classic - function added; verify 2/3rds rule for NPC moving and DoT damage - function added; Determine which/how the spell_worn _off message is/if used - rule added - 12/4/15 - new rule implementation and reversion of of old rule - complete 2/4/16

ToDo: Check zone lag of boats with other players - 12/19/15

; ToDo: casting skills acquired after level 1 currently do not require training - verifies through canis, 1 source although it seems logical
	- I think this is fine, meditate requires training IIRC but, ask around, would probably be a simple fix

ToDo: look into DS damage and XP
	- kevin said character must do 1 point of damage which makes sense iirc

; ToDo: verify stun fix - mob kick stunning character - ask around - fixed with new rule done - 2/4/16
	- npc kicks have a chance to stun always (15% like bash) - \zone\attack.cpp(3716)
	- need to verify how this works somehow
	- made a NPC level rule with current % to easily switch if level is incorrect - complete

ToDo: j-boots and rubicite look into
	J-Boots:
	- j-boots is on a fabled NPCs loottable (expansion 7)
	- Hasten_Bootstrutter in Rathe Mts - spawn condition 2 w/e that means - C:\EQ\EQEmuServer\quests\rathemtn
	- ancient cyclops 8% in Nro and 20% in OOT
	Rubicite:
	- the items are enabled although not all pieces drop from current NPCs
	- will need to consider balance, current drops are a quite high

ToDo: spawns? - kracken lake rathe - mayong mistmoore - mistmoore
	- no kracken

ToDo: projects in WIP folder - ongoing

ToDo: Look into light source for split paw hide mask - currently it's a huge radius - 12/11/15

ToDo: <skilldisarm> does not appear to be implemented - 12/29/15

ToDo: Can't spawn mobs in the arena for some reason - this is very recent and may have something to do with the "Z" rule - 1/21/16

ToDo: ward undead should not resist so much - I think this a resist issue and not a spell issue - 2/4/16

ToDo: mobs runspeed seems a touch slow now - 2/4/16

- STUMPED_ISSUES
........................
ToDo: make ability timers reset if unable to use (kick/bash/range attack) too close/too far/self - \zone\special_attacks.cpp(208,711) - unsure if this is possible
	- range attack: - I'm skeptical the button being greyed out or not is something this code can change, I believe it is a client thing
		- 1with no target the button is not disabled
		- 2with a target too close, even if not facing, the button is disabled
		- 3with a target that is not self and not facing the target or is far out of range, the button is not disabled
		- with a target just out of range, the button is disabled -> this likely occurs due to movement and client/server not being exact
	- possibly not <Client::OPCombatAbility> - \zone\special_attacks.cpp(436)
		- ptimer

ToDo: Skill which can't be acquired show up in the client UI - probably a dbstr.txt file in the client
	- eqstr_us.txt is the file - <2161 LEVEL: %1>
	- unable to locate anyplace in the code which would affect this

ToDo: issue with improper plat being recorded in `qs_merchant_transaction_record`
	- and improper charges in `qs_merchant_transaction_record_entries
	- I don't see a way to make this better - I looked through the area of code

ToDo: put a death animation in for /pet go away - 1/21/16
	- no luck with changes
	
........................
........................
- NON_ESSENTIAL
........................
ToDo: for Adam: work on NPC appearance w/ DB - many GMs, merchants, etc. - they are default ugly - 12/15/15 (fuck him slacker bitch)

ToDo: custom titles for characters who do something special - 12/30/15

ToDo: Look into PVP code - certain dots, maybe with snare component, in PVP have very short snare duration and keep the damage for full duration - 12/20/15

ToDo: create trivial loot code with cazic thule in mind (rubicite)

ToDo: for Adam: make same mobs in zone but different level vary in size (fuck him slacker bitch)

ToDo: create something to suspend the account for a short period of time if /q-ing out

ToDo: look into automatic guild membership to start with separate guild membership optional

ToDo: think about creating expansion rules which would make it easy to switch code from one expansion to another

ToDo: come up with a mob kill counter - like a tally of xp hits or qs NPC kills

ToDo: IDEA: somehow create progression for each character as in: once they accomplish something they can move on to the next expansion

ToDo: add logging features for GMs logging on multiple accounts or possibly qserv

ToDo: think about creating a faction that if lowered, will decrease faction with the norrath scientists/dungeon necromancers - 1/21/16
	- like a penalty if you kill too many citizens or guards
	- would require creating a new faction, setting everyone to amiable or something, and populating the list with all guard/citizen factions
	- this would also require putting this faction on all guard/citizen faction lists
	- would also need to change the quests to only accept them at a certain faction level but never go kos

ToDo: idea - have exploding corpses when looted causing damage (ae) - 1/28/16
